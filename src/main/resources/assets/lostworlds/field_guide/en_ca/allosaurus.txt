Allosaurus fragilis, the "Different Lizard," was a large 
Jurassic  apex predator that lived from 155 to 145 
million years ago. Allosaurus would've eaten anything it 
could attack. Allosaurus stalked the  Morrison 
Formation in North America and even in Portugal. They 
were first described in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh. 
Allosaurus is most famous for its dual head crests.
