Allosaurus fragilis "Different Lizard" was a large Jurassic apex predator. 
They are well known for their duel-crested head. Stegosaurus is one of 
the most commonly known prey of the Allosaurus. Kentrosaurus and other 
similarly-size creatures would also be victims of the Allosaurus. 
Allosaurus fragilis is the second small of the three known types. They 
grew up to 12 metres in length, but a more common size would've been 
10 metres. Allosaurus lived from 155 to 145 million years ago during
the mid to late jurassic. The first fossil of the Allosaurus was
described in 1877 by Othniel Charles Marsh. Allosaurus has been found
in North America's Morison Formation and Portugal. It's niche would've
been the Apex of the Morison Formation.
